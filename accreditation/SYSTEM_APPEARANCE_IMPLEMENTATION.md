## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Templates
- **`templates/dashboard/system_appearance.html`** - Complete appearance customization UI
- **`templates/dashboard_base.html`** - Added dynamic theme loading script
- **`templates/auth/login.html`** - Added dynamic background and logo loading

### 2. Backend Views (`dashboard_views.py`)
- `system_appearance_view()` - Main page view
- `get_appearance_settings()` - GET endpoint to fetch current settings
- `save_theme_color()` - POST endpoint to save theme color
- `upload_logo()` - POST endpoint to upload logo
- `remove_logo()` - POST endpoint to remove logo
- `save_system_title()` - POST endpoint to save system title
- `upload_background()` - POST endpoint to upload background
- `remove_background()` - POST endpoint to remove background

### 3. URL Routes (`dashboard_urls.py`)
Added the following routes:
```python
path('settings/appearance/', dashboard_views.system_appearance_view, name='system_appearance')
path('settings/appearance/get/', dashboard_views.get_appearance_settings, name='get_appearance_settings')
path('settings/appearance/save-color/', dashboard_views.save_theme_color, name='save_theme_color')
path('settings/appearance/upload-logo/', dashboard_views.upload_logo, name='upload_logo')
path('settings/appearance/remove-logo/', dashboard_views.remove_logo, name='remove_logo')
path('settings/appearance/save-title/', dashboard_views.save_system_title, name='save_system_title')
path('settings/appearance/upload-background/', dashboard_views.upload_background, name='upload_background')
path('settings/appearance/remove-background/', dashboard_views.remove_background, name='remove_background')
```

## Database Structure

### Firestore Collection: `system_settings`
Document with `setting_type: 'appearance'` contains:
```json
{
  "setting_type": "appearance",
  "theme_color": "#4a9d4f",
  "system_title": "PLP Accreditation System",
  "logo_url": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
  "login_bg_url": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
```

## Security & Access Control

- **Access Level**: QA Head and QA Admin only
- **Role Check**: All endpoints verify user role before allowing modifications
- **CSRF Protection**: All POST requests require valid CSRF token
- **File Validation**: 
  - File size limit: 5MB
  - Allowed types: image/* (PNG, JPG, GIF)

## Audit Trail

Every action is logged to the `audit_trail` collection with:
- User information (ID, email, name)
- Action type (create, update, delete)
- Resource type (system_appearance)
- Resource ID (theme_color, logo, system_title, login_background)
- Details (description of what was changed)
- Status (success/failed)
- IP address
- Timestamp

### Logged Actions:
1. **Theme Color Changes** - "Changed theme color to #XXXXXX"
2. **Logo Upload** - "Uploaded new system logo: [URL]"
3. **Logo Removal** - "Removed system logo"
4. **Title Changes** - "Changed system title to: [New Title]"
5. **Background Upload** - "Uploaded new login background: [URL]"
6. **Background Removal** - "Removed login background, reset to default"

## User Experience Features

### Confirmation Modals
All destructive or important actions require confirmation:
- Changing theme color
- Resetting theme color
- Uploading logo
- Removing logo
- Saving system title
- Resetting system title
- Uploading background
- Removing background

Modal types used:
- `save` - For saving changes (green icon)
- `delete` - For removal actions (red icon)
- `warning` - For reset actions (yellow icon)

### Toast Notifications
All actions show toast notifications with status:
- **Success** - Green toast with success message
- **Error** - Red toast with error message
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

### Loading States
- Upload buttons show spinner during upload
- Buttons disabled during processing
- Visual feedback for better UX

## How It Works

### On Page Load (Any Page)
1. Browser fetches appearance settings from `/dashboard/settings/appearance/get/`
2. JavaScript applies settings dynamically:
   - Updates CSS variables for theme color
   - Changes logo images
   - Updates system title in header and page title
   - Applies background image on login page

### Color Customization Flow
1. User selects color from color picker
2. Real-time preview updates showing 3 variants
3. User clicks "Save Color"
4. Confirmation modal appears
5. On confirm, sends POST to `/dashboard/settings/appearance/save-color/`
6. Backend saves to Firestore and logs audit trail
7. Success toast appears
8. Page refreshes to apply new color

### Image Upload Flow
1. User selects file
2. Client-side validation (size, type)
3. Preview shown with upload/cancel buttons
4. User clicks "Upload"
5. Confirmation modal appears
6. On confirm, sends FormData to upload endpoint
7. Backend:
   - Deletes old image from Cloudinary (if exists)
   - Uploads new image to Cloudinary
   - Saves URL to Firestore
   - Logs audit trail
8. Success toast and page refresh

### Image Removal Flow
1. User clicks "Remove"
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. On confirm, sends POST to remove endpoint
4. Backend:
   - Deletes image from Cloudinary
   - Clears URL in Firestore (or sets to default)
   - Logs audit trail
5. Success toast and page refresh

## Cloudinary Integration
