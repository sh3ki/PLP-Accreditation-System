# Dashboard Implementation Summary - All Data from Database

## ✅ COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

All 3 role-based dashboards are now **fully functional** and fetching **real data from Firestore database**.

---

## 📊 Database Collections Used

All dashboards query the following Firestore collections:

1. **users** - User accounts and authentication
2. **documents** - Uploaded accreditation documents
3. **departments** - Academic departments (CCS, CED, etc.)
4. **programs** - Academic programs (BSCS, BSIT, BEED, BSED)
5. **areas** - Accreditation areas (Area 1, Area 2, etc.)
6. **checklists** - Document checklist items per area
7. **audit_logs** - System activity audit trail
8. **accreditation_types** - Types of accreditation (COPC, ALCUCOA)

---

## 🎯 Dashboard Features by Role

### 1. QA HEAD DASHBOARD (`qa_head_dashboard.html`)

**Data Sources:**
- Total Users: Count from `users` collection
- Total Documents: Count from `documents` collection
- Total Programs: Count from `programs` collection (status='active')

---

### 3. DEPARTMENT USER DASHBOARD (`department_dashboard.html`)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Functions (`dashboard_views.py`)

```python
def dashboard_home(request):
    """Routes to role-specific dashboard data function"""
    user_role = request.session['user_role']
    
    if user_role == 'qa_head':
        context = get_qa_head_dashboard_data(user)
    elif user_role == 'qa_admin':
        context = get_qa_admin_dashboard_data(user)
    elif user_role == 'department_user':
        context = get_department_dashboard_data(user)
```

### Data Fetching Functions

**get_qa_head_dashboard_data(user)**
- Queries: users, documents, programs, departments, areas, checklists, audit_logs
- Calculations: User counts, document trends, department progress
- Returns: Statistics dict, chart data (JSON), activity lists

**get_qa_admin_dashboard_data(user)**
- Queries: documents, programs, areas, checklists
- Calculations: Status distribution, weekly trends, area progress
- Returns: Statistics dict, chart data (JSON), recent documents

**get_department_dashboard_data(user)**
- Queries: documents (filtered by department_id), areas, checklists
- Calculations: Department-specific metrics, area completion
- Returns: Statistics dict, chart data (JSON), activities, deadlines

### Datetime Handling Fix

Added `safe_get_datetime()` helper function to handle mixed datetime formats:

```python
def safe_get_datetime(doc, field_name):
    """Safely convert timestamp to datetime object"""
    value = doc.get(field_name)
    if isinstance(value, datetime):
        return value
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        try:
            return datetime.fromisoformat(value.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
        except:
            try:
                return datetime.strptime(value, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')
            except:
                return datetime.min
    return datetime.min
```

This fixes sorting and date comparison issues when Firestore returns timestamps as strings.

## 🎨 Chart Configurations

### Chart.js Integration

All dashboards use **Chart.js 3.x** for visualizations:

**QA Head:**
- Doughnut chart: Department document distribution
- Line chart: 30-day upload timeline

**QA Admin:**
- Doughnut chart: Document status distribution
- Bar chart: Department upload comparison
- Line chart: 7-day weekly trends

**Department:**
- Line chart: 30-day upload progress
- Pie chart: Status breakdown

**Theme Integration:**
All charts dynamically use the system's theme color via:
```javascript
getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--plp-green').trim()
```

---

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

### Sidebar Menu Filtering

Audit Trail menu item is **hidden** for department users:
```html
{% if user.role == 'qa_head' or user.role == 'qa_admin' %}
<li class="sidebar-item">
    <a href="{% url 'dashboard:audit' %}">Audit Trail</a>
</li>
{% endif %}
```

### Dashboard Routing

```python
# dashboard_views.py
if user_role == 'qa_head':
    # Full system overview
elif user_role == 'qa_admin':
    # Accreditation-focused view
elif user_role == 'department_user':
    # Department-specific view (filtered by department_id)
```
