## 🚀 How to Deploy - Quick Start

### Step 1: Read the Master Guide
Open and read: `deployment/MASTER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

This has **EVERYTHING** you need in 12 phases:
- Phase 1-3: Server setup, software installation, domain configuration
- Phase 4-6: Application setup, database, environment variables
- Phase 7-9: Django setup, Gunicorn, Nginx
- Phase 10-11: SSL certificate, final testing
- Phase 12: Verification

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours for first deployment

### Step 2: Follow the Phases
The guide is designed to be followed **step-by-step**. Don't skip phases!

### Step 3: Your Credentials
You'll need:
- ✅ **Firebase**: Your existing `firebase-service-account.json` file
- ✅ **Cloudinary**: API Key & Secret (from https://cloudinary.com/console)
- ✅ **Email**: Already configured (accreditationsystem2023@gmail.com)
- ✅ **VPS**: IP address and root password from Hostinger

---

## 🔐 About Your Credentials

**Important**: You're keeping ALL existing credentials!

### Firebase (Authentication & Database)
- **Project**: plp-accreditation
- **What to do**: Upload your `firebase-service-account.json` to server
- **Result**: Same data, same users, works identically

### Cloudinary (File/Image Storage)
- **Cloud Name**: dygrh6ztt
- **What to do**: Add API Key & Secret to server's `.env` file
- **Result**: All existing images still work, new uploads work

### Email (OTP Verification)
- **Account**: accreditationsystem2023@gmail.com
- **What to do**: Nothing! Already configured
- **Result**: OTP emails work automatically

📖 **Details**: See `deployment/CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md`

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### During Deployment
1. **Don't panic!** Check the troubleshooting section in MASTER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
2. Read error messages carefully
3. Check logs: `/var/log/plp_accreditation.err.log`

### Common Issues
- **502 Bad Gateway**: Gunicorn not running → restart supervisor
- **Static files missing**: Run `collectstatic` → restart nginx
- **Database error**: Check .env credentials
- **Firebase error**: Verify JSON file uploaded correctly
- **Cloudinary error**: Check API key/secret in .env

### Get Help
- **Troubleshooting section**: In each guide
- **Hostinger Support**: https://www.hostinger.com/contact
- **Check logs**: All errors are logged

## 🎉 After Successful Deployment

Your site will be live at: **https://plpaccreditation.com**

### What Works:
✅ HTTPS (secure connection with SSL certificate)
✅ User authentication (Firebase)
✅ Database (PostgreSQL + Firestore)
✅ File uploads (Cloudinary)
✅ Email OTP verification
✅ All your existing data
✅ Auto-renewal of SSL certificates

### For Future Updates:
Just push to GitHub, then on server run:
```bash
cd /home/plpadmin/PLP-Accreditation-System/accreditation/deployment
bash deploy.sh
```

---

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Daily Backups (Automated)
The deployment includes a backup script that runs daily at 2 AM.

### Updates
When you make changes:
1. Develop and test locally
2. Push to GitHub
3. Run `deploy.sh` on server

### Monitoring
Check logs regularly:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/plp_accreditation.err.log
```
