                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            On March 15, 1999, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Pasig passed Ordinance No. 11, Series of 1999, establishing 
                            the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig, and appropriated funds for its operations. The authority of the Sangguniang 
                            Panlungsod ng Pasig to establish the Pamantasan is Article III, Sections 447, 458, 468 of the Local Government 
                            Code of 1991 which allowed institutions to be established and operated by Local Government Units.

                            The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig was part of the Pasig City Development Plan of 2000, and the City's response 
                            to the challenges of the new millennium. Consistent with the vision of its founder, the University utilizes all
