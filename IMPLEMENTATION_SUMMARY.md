## ðŸŽ¯ HOW IT WORKS

### User Creation Flow:
1. QA Head clicks "Add User" button
2. Form opens with: First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Email Prefix, Department, Role, Status
3. QA Head fills in the form (NO password field)
4. Clicks "Save"
5. System auto-generates strong password
6. User is created in Firebase with `is_password_changed=False`
7. Modal shows generated password (e.g., "Tiger@2024")
8. QA Head gives this password to the new user

### First Login Flow:
1. New user logs in with auto-generated password
2. System checks `is_password_changed` field â†’ False
3. Modal automatically appears (user cannot access dashboard)
4. User enters new password twice
5. System validates and updates password
6. `is_password_changed` set to True
7. Page reloads, user can now access dashboard normally

### Subsequent Logins:
1. User logs in with their new password
2. System checks `is_password_changed` field â†’ True
3. No modal appears, direct access to dashboard
